These features appear in the <strong>Debug</strong> menu of the application. These menu items are as follows:</p>		<p><strong>Print Session</strong>: Prints debugging information about the state of the AU Lab application. As mentioned in the <a href="#loadMeter">Filing Bugs</a> section below, this information is useful to send along with your bug report if you believe that you have found a problem in the AU Lab application.</p>		<p><strong>Uninitialize Session/Initialize Session</strong>: This will stop the engine and uninitialize all Audio Units in the document. Conversely, Initialize Session will re-initialize all Audio Units. This menu item is useful for debugging problems with initialization in your Audio Unit code.</p>		<p><strong>Reset Audio Unit Sandbox Information</strong>: Clears the cached information about Audio Units and the Sandbox state. Any attempts by any Audio Unit host to open a non-sandbox safe AU will result in an alert. This alert will prompt the user to allow opening the Audio Unit and drop the sandbox, or deny the open. See the <a href="#appSandbox">Sandbox</a> section below for more details.</p>				<h4><a name="loadMeter"></a>CPU Load Meter</h4>		<p><img class="rightImage" src="gfx/Debug/CPULoad.gif" alt="" width="72" height="186">AU Lab has a CPU load meter that indicates how much CPU load the audio units in your document are using. This is more accurate than using top because it only measures the load from the audio units and not the AU Lab application itself.</p>		<p>As the image to the right shows, the meter shows a green portion which is the average load and a white bar which is the peak load. The higher the bar is, the more CPU the Audio Units in the document are using. The numerical value above the meter shows the cpu usage as a percentage.</p>		<p>Keep in mind that even if overall cpu usage is low, Audio Overloads can still be triggered if your audio unit is trying to do more work than can be completed in its IOProc. See <a href="Preferences.html#ExpertSettings">managing latency</a> for more information.</p>		<p>Note that each document can have its own load meter. To access the CPU Load Meter, choose <strong>Show CPU Load</strong> from the <strong>Window</strong> menu.</p>				<h4><a name="appSandbox"></a>App Sandbox</h4>		<p>AU Lab now runs in an App Sandbox. It can load all Sandbox-safe or non-Sandbox-safe Audio Units.</p>		<p><img class="rightImage" src="gfx/Sandbox/SandboxDialog.gif" alt="" width="420" height="167">When an Audio Unit that is not sandbox safe is loaded for the first time, the system presents a dialog alerting the user that the security settings need to be lowered in order to use the selected Audio Unit. Once the user has elected to lower the security settings, this dialog will not reappear for			that specific Audio Unit opening in that specific host.</p>		<p>You can reset the stored sandbox information by choosing <strong>Reset Audio Unit Sandbox Information</strong> from the <strong>Debug</strong> menu.</p>		<p>The Sandbox version of AU Lab behaves the same as the previous non-sandboxed version with a few minor differences.</p>		<ul>			<li>The AU Lab icon changes when the security settings are lowered (when an unsafe Audio Unit is loaded)<img class="rightImage" src="gfx/Sandbox/Icons.gif" alt="" width="230" height="118"></li>			<li>AU Lab may ask the user for permission to access media files referenced from AU Presets or documents located in directories that it does not have an entitlement for read access</li>			<li>AU Lab can only create audio recordings automatically in entitled directories such as the user's Music directory</li>		</ul>						<h4><a name="filingBugs"></a>Filing Bugs</h4>		<p>We encourage you to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/index.html">file any bugs</a> that you may find in AU Lab. Make sure you include a copy of your AudioUnit if the bug is specific to your unit, and also include a snapshot of the Engine State. You can get this information by going to the <strong>Debug</strong> menu and choosing <strong>Print Session</strong>. This will output debugging information to the console. Including this information will help us fix your problem.</p>		<p>We would love your feedback and comments in order to help make AU Lab a better product.</p>		<p>A special thanks to all those Audio Unit developers out there who have given us so much inspiration!</p>		<p>Thank you!</p>		<p>AU Lab and CoreAudio Engineering</p>				<h4>Revision History</h4>		<p>2.0.1</p>		<ul>			<li>Fixed an issue with the inspector window not handling mouse-moved events for some carbon-based au views</li>			<li>Fixed a crash recording with a time delay</li>			<li>Changed the sorting of audio units and manufacturers in the effects popup menu to be case-insensitive</li>			<li>Addressed application stability issues</li>		</ul>		<p>2.1</p>		<ul>			<li>Fixed the window sizing behavior for cocoa-based audio units that change their size</li>			<li>Graphical rendering enhancements</li>			<li>Added support for new Snow Leopard Technologies</li>		</ul>		<p>2.2</p>		<ul>			<li>Added new Document Configuration Editor which adds support for documents with different input and output audio devices</li>			<li>Removed device selection popup menu from Output Track Editor</li>			<li>Improved Audio Tab of Studio View Drawer to add support for changing input device</li>		</ul>		<p>2.3</p>		<ul>			<li>AU Lab is now app Sandboxed</li>			<li>Added ability to resolve AU preset files that contain file-references</li>			<li>Added Audio Input View</li>			<li>Application Icon changes to indicate whether application is sandboxed</li>			<li>AU Lab now uses system Audio Unit cache</li>			<li>Added menu item for clearing system Audio Unit Sandbox Information cache</li>			<li>Added the ability to record multiple output tracks simultaneously</li>			<li>Added the ability to record audio input via Audio Input View</li>		</ul>	</body></html>
